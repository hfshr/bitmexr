To access private endpoints in the Bitmex API, authentication is needed. First, An API key needs to be generated for the account you want to use with `bitmexr`. For guidance see https://www.bitmex.com/app/restAPI#Authentication

When you have an API key, edit your .Renviron file and include both the key and secret.

Open .Renviron:

```r
file.edit("~/.Renviron")
```

For a testnet API key use:

```
bitmex_apikey_testnet = "your testnet api key"
bitmex_apisecret_testnet = "your testnet api sectret"
```

For a live API key use:

```
bitmex_apikey = "your live api key"
bitmex_apisecret = "your live api sectret"
```

Functions in `bitmexr` requiring authentication will use these keys when creating the encrypted signature to send to private API endpoints. I would highly recommend experimenting with the testnet API prior to using the live API when it comes to submitting/editing/cancelling orders, and of course, use these functions at your own risk.
